I know money is the most important thing to you. It is for me too. I am prepared to pay the right person a lot of money, especially for a remote job. This is up to you and I to discuss. If you want equity I am willing to do that after a standard vesting cliff period. In fact I would love if you really wanted equity and were that type of person -- one that cared about the long-term.\n\nSaga Ventures is hiring for the role of CTO/Tech Lead. Weâll give you any title you want if you get things done. \n\nAs CTO/Tech Lead you will be responsible for the oversight of, the hiring process of and the development of multiple web and mobile applications. \n\nSaga Ventures is a startup based in Switzerland that builds products that solve its founderâs problems. Basically the founder is solving his own problems with software. The founder is technical but has too many ideas and wants to implement more than one idea at a time. Your job is to lead the development of these software projects. Whether that is outsourcing hiring on freelance websites or hiring full time employees, thatâs your choice (almost entirely; I may push back on a decision to see how well youâve thought it out or something like that).\n\nTop 5 reasons to work with Saga Ventures.\n\nThe person you report to (me, the guy writing this) wants as minimal contact as possible. This means you will be working autonomously almost the entire time. You will be asked to give a weekly report of the progress made each week on each application. This is how I will judge your performance. I will track budgeting with you. We may need to have calls, especially at the beginning of the job, but I generally do not like having calls. I am not one of those bosses who insists on doing things for the sake of doing them.\n\nThis is not a role where you will learn from others, technically speaking. You should be confident and familiar with all aspects of web and mobile application development (React Native specific). You should be comfortable with and desire to work independently.\n\nThe ideas and applications we are working on are not pie in the sky ideas. They are all intended to solve current problems of the founder. For some of the ideas, competing applications exist. For others, the problems we will be working on are not currently realized by the public. They are new. One example problem is how to easily share only the code that a remote developer needs to work on a repository of code.\n\nTwo of the five ideas have partially developed apps. They need love and attention from someone focused.\n\nThe themes of the products are:\n\nRemote Work\nInvesting and Finance\nLanguage Learning\nLongevity/Anti-aging\n\nAll of the above themes are passions of his and industries he is highly experienced in (except longevity, that is a mere passion with a missing website ;).\n\nThings I Care About\n\nYour ability to work independently on full feature sets bringing product specifications to life.\nYou should basically never ask me a technical question. I am trying to not code at all here. I do product, design, strategy, finance, business stuff. You do and lead everything else.\nBe able to take ownership of problems with a determination to solve them (this sentence was from a boilerplate job description from another one that I copied but it sounded good.\n\nThings I donât care about:\n\nAgile development or any other development styles and how you get things built. [I may steer you towards certain development approaches though (such as using the same tech stack and directory structure across apps to maximize development efficiency)].\nWhere you live\nWhen you work on a daily basis. If we donât have to speak with one another, we donât. It would be great if we could be a text-only company. Automattic is. Why canât Saga Ventures be?\n\n\nSkills required:\n\nReact/React-Native/React-Native-Web for frontend\nExperience leading development projects or the confidence and ability to do so\nWould be nice if you had a good understanding of AWS with some devops experience\n\nAs CTO/Tech Lead you must be highly proficient in React Native. We share as much code as possible between mobile and web applications by using the React Native Web package.\n\nOur backend is the classic Express, MongoDB/Mongoose.","epoch":"1631105493","id":"105912","location":"Worldwide","logo":"https://remoteOK.io/assets/jobs/57a72e9ad817c83cefaff7a3f87dfc221631105493.png","original":true,"position":"Tech Lead CTO","slug":"105912-remote-tech-lead-cto-saga-ventures","tags":["react native","react","react native web","finance","longevity","remote work","language learning","javascript","web dev","tech lead","exec"],"url":"https://remoteOK.io/remote-jobs/105912-remote-tech-lead-cto-saga-ventures"},{"apply_url":"https://remoteOK.io/remote-jobs/105911-remote-systems-engineer-tucows","company":"Tucows","company_logo":"https://remoteOK.io/assets/jobs/c145c80262b496e798ed25300554d15c1631104227.png","date":"2021-09-08T12:30:27+00:00","description":"The Mobile Engineering Team is looking for the right engineer with a strong Devops and automation background to join our team.

Are you looking for an international and fast-paced, yet collaborative and inclusive environment to thrive in?\n\nYou have come to the right place.\n\nCitizenLab, a social impact scale-up with its HQ in Brussels, aims to make public decision-making more participatory, inclusive, and responsive. The SaaS platform is already being used by over 300 cities and municipalities in +18 different countries, facilitating two-way communication between governments and their citizens. Since it was founded in 2015, CitizenLab gave +750,000 citizens a direct voice in local politics and got recognized as 'Best Social Impact Startup in Europe'. CitizenLab is looking for purpose-driven talent to join us on our mission to have +2.5 million citizens actively participate via its e-democracy platforms in cities across the globe.\n\n## Senior Product Designer at CitizenLab\n\nAs Senior Product Designer, you play a key role in both shaping the future of our digital democracy platform through superbly researched and designed solutions, as well as bringing Design at CitizenLab to a whole new level overall by setting a design system in place to collaborate with other designers.\n\nYou are a member of the cross-functional Engagement squad, with a product manager and five engineers. The Engagement squad is working on our core participation platform, with the goal of getting more citizens involved in democracy and designing higher-impact participatory processes. You will report to the team lead of Product, and closely collaborate with the visual designer, product designer (Insights), and product managers. Initially, you will work with other designers in a working group structure, yet we expect a separate Design team to emerge in the near future as we continue to grow.\n\nYour responsibilities include:\n\n*   Drive the evolution of our **design system**, working with the product teams to build Figma libraries and documentation within clear frameworks and guidelines.\n\n*   Work closely with engineering peers to implement **high-quality solutions.**\n\n*   Leverage **research techniques** and tools such as wireframes, sketches, and live-data prototypes to test and improve **product experiences.**\n\n*   **Design components, interactions, and transitions** in Figma and thoroughly test the **usability** of the solution with real users and data.\n\n*   Ensure a consistent and evolving **visual identity** across all touchpoints, including all our products, in close collaboration with the visual designer.\n\n*   Act as a **coach and mentor other designers** on the team, and help them grow.\n\n## What do we expect from you?\n\n*   **+5 years of experience** in product design, ideally in a tech environment. You know whatâs needed to scale design when growing from start-up to scale-up.\n\n*   Demonstrable experience building or contributing to a **design system**, including component design, documentation, and education.\n\n*   Outstanding ability to **deliver designs** **from concept to implementation**; from user flows to prototypes to world-class UI design.\n\n*   Strong appetite to help other designers grow through your **mentoring**. Ideally, previous experience **leading a design team**.\n\n*   Advanced knowledge of **Figmaâs** design tool. Working knowledge of other contemporary design and prototyping tools, e.g. Framer or Principle.\n\n*   Good knowledge of **HTML and CSS**, as well as a basic familiarity with **ReactJS**, to be able to implement some of your own designs.\n\n*   Understanding of technical constraints when designing solutions. Familiarity with **inclusive design** principles and best practices.\n\n*   Strong communication, **collaboration** and creative problem-solving skills.\n\n*   Well-developed **UX research** competences and highly familiar with a wide range of techniques for product discovery, user behavior, and usability testing.\n\n*   Ideally, strong **UX writing** skills. You enjoy crafting delightful microcopy. And helping us write better job ads for future design hires.\n\n*   Very fluent in **English**. Proficiency in Dutch, French, or other European languages can be a plus for your research.\n\n*   Working in the **European timezone**. Possibility to relocate to Brussels is a bonus, not a must.\n\n## What can you expect from us?\n\n*   Unlock your full potential and have a social **impact at scale**. Day-to-day we work with local government leaders across the world to help them connect with their communities.\n\n*   Become a key factor in our rapid transition from a startup to a **scaleup** (50 employees), and our expansion from Europe to the United States.\n\n*   Work in a **fast-paced, collaborative, and supportive** environment. We share a participatory culture of autonomy and ownership by everyone, not only by leadership.\n\n*   Be part of our **dynamic, international team**. We organize many team activities and afterworks (when possible). We are as serious about our work in digital democracy as we are about having fun on our journey together.\n\n*   Enjoy an **informal work vibe** with open communication and full transparency on results.\n\n*   Participate in our **various team events**, inspiring team lunches, our company book club, bi-quarterly strategic town halls, and yearly off-site team retreats.\n\n*   Spend 10% of your time on **personal projects and self-development** for the long run. Weâre committed to both collective and individual growth.\n\n*   Receive a **competitive salary package**, incl. perks such as 26 paid holidays, a professional development budget, well-being budget, collective bonus plan, your own laptop, full flexibility on working from home, and much more.\n\n_CitizenLab is committed to being a diverse and inclusive workplace.
