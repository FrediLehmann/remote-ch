      'At Density, we build one of the most advanced people sensing systems in the world. The product and infrastructure is nuanced and one-of-a-kind. Building this product for scale has been an exercise in patience, creativity, remarkable engineering, laser physics, global logistics, and grit. The team is thoughtful, driven, and world-class.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nWe build systems that are real-time, accurate, and anonymous by design. Our systems help today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest companies understand how their buildings get used. We have counted hundreds of millions of people.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nCounting people in \u00e2\u0080\u009creal-time\u00e2\u0080\u009d is unique and particularly hard to achieve. It allows a user to walk into a room, beneath our sensor, and see the room\u00e2\u0080\u0099s occupancy increment 700ms later.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nToday alone, Density will ingest over 1m events. In the coming year, our sensor network is on track to grow ten-fold. The overall system load is exploding. Maintaining our low latency standards requires an increasingly thoughtful system.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re architecting infrastructure where annual, unscheduled downtime is measured in minutes. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building intelligent redundancies so missed events are an oddity. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re constructing an exceptional engineering team to support always-on, intelligible analytics generated on the fly.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThis role reports to our Director of Data Science & Engineering. \n\nAs a Data Scientist at Density, you will work on algorithms developed for applications deployed on state-of-the-art remote devices as well as our cloud platform. The data you will work with includes ToF depth data, point clouds from radar, and device parameters. Algorithms include computer vision segmentation identification, 3D point cloud surface analysis, and optimization algorithms for sensor tuning. Join a team of experienced data scientists as we expand what is possible.\n\n',

      "Integration Engineers provide the technical backbone for all of our integrations. Our job is not only to delight our customers, but ensure we maintain a toolbox full of robust, reusable tools to quickly and easily solve the toughest integrations. We wear different hats - developer, problem solver, quarterback - to ensure Redox can provide an agile, scalable solution to our customers! \n\nIf you enjoy variety, solving for the root cause, and the sense of accomplishment that comes from solving ambiguous and challenging problems, then we want you as part of the team!\n\nPlease keep reading...\nResearch shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalized folks tend to only apply when they check every box. So if you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nAbout Redox:\n\nWhat We Do\nHealthcare organizations and technology vendors connect to Redox once, then authorize what data they send to and receive from partners through a centralized hub. Redox's cloud-based platform is vendor and standards agnostic and enables the secure and efficient exchange of healthcare data.\n\nThis approach eradicates the need for point-to-point integrations and accelerates the discovery, adoption, and distribution of patient and provider-facing technology solutions. With hundreds of healthcare organizations and technology vendors exchanging data today, Redox represents the largest interoperable network in healthcare. Learn how you can leverage the Redox platform at www.redoxengine.com.\n\nOther Stuff About Us\nRedox is an EEO company. We fully support the diversity of our team! Here's a recent blog post about our stance on diversity and belonging: Diversity at Redox\n\nWe believe in holding ourselves to a high standard of conduct. Here's how we think about this: Redox Code of Conduct\n\nSuccessful candidates must be eligible to be employed in the US, and must reside in the US.\n\nThank you for your interest in Redox!",
